-- One way of doing it: 
DECLARE @Names VARCHAR(8000)  
SELECT @Names = COALESCE(@Names + ', ', '') + COALESCE(MyCol, '') 
FROM [MyTable] 
WHERE MyCol IS NOT NULL 
 
SELECT @Names 
 
 
-- Better way of doing it: 
SELECT (SELECT DISTINCT '' + MyCol + ';  ' FROM [MyTable] AS L FOR XML PATH('')) 
 
 
-- Best way of doing it since MSSQL 2017 & Oracle & PostgresSQL: 
SELECT string_agg(DISTINCT <column>,'delimiter') FROM <table> GROUP BY <column2>
